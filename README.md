### About me

I started a long time ago with traditional languages (C/C++) on Windows, creating system utilities and things to speed up my own development process; but then I stumbled upon web technologies and here I am, coding for a living in PHP, Javascript and more!

Through the years I've used the main frameworks, platforms and languages that shaped the web and cloud-based services as we known them today. I'm full-stack versed, with a pinch of dev-ops and a lot of system engineering. Many of my public repos deal with front-end stuff, but I do a heap of back-end work in my day-to-day.
